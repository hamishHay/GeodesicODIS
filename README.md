# ODIS
Ocean Dissipation in Icy Satellites

# GeodesicODIS

GeodesicODIS is a finite volume fluid dynamics code for simulating oceanic flow in icy satellites and other bodies. GeodesicODIS currently solves the Laplace Tidal Equations (LTEs) assuming a free surface, neglecting the effects of an overlying ice shell.

CAUTION: GeodesicODIS is still under development and may be unstable/unreliable.

## GeodesicODIS vs ODIS

GeodesicODIS is a new version of the finite difference code ODIS. ODIS solved the laplace tidal equations over a rectangular structured latl-lon mesh, while GeodesicODIS does the same over an unstructured mesh based on the icosahedral-geodesic grid.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
