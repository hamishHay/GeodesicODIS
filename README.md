# ODIS
Ocean Dissipation in Icy Satellites

GeodesicODIS is a finite volume fluid dynamics code for simulating oceanic flow in icy satellites and other bodies.

CAUTION: GeodesicODIS is still under development and may be unstable/unreliable.

# GeodesicODIS vs ODIS

GeodesicODIS is a new version of the finite difference code ODIS. ODIS solved the laplace tidal equations over a rectangular structured latl-lon mesh, while GeodesicODIS does the same over an unstructured mesh based on the icosahedral-geodesic grid.
